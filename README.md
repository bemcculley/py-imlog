# py-imlog
## A module that parses IM client logs

imlog is a module that can be used to parse logs generated by IM clients. Currently is supports [Adium](http://adium.im/) and [iChat](http://www.apple.com/macosx/apps/all.html#ichat).

### Adium support
Both the legacy XML file and current [bundle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_bundle) formats of Adium logs are supported.

### iChat support
If you wish to parse the default iChat logging format, which are serialized ObjC objects, you need to have the [plutil](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/plutil.1.html) utility installed and in the PATH of the python app. Support for iChat messages is mostly working, but the format of the logs took a bit reverse engineering to understand...

### Example usage

```python
import imlog

path = '/path/to/some/adium/log.chatlog'
log = imlog.AdiumLog(path)
for msg in log.messages:
    print msg.sender
    print msg.text
    print msg.html
```
